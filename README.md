# Classification-Methods-for-Predicting-Telco-Subscription-Customer-Churn

This dataset, which is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn?resource=download, takes data that comes from a customer retention program.

They find out that the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one.

So our goal is to build a classifier that could takes in existing data, which information is introduced later, to predict if a customer will leave or remain.

For the dataset, each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes described on the column Metadata.

The data set includes information about:

Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn

Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies

Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges

Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
